# SmartAdmin Responsive WebApp

## Licensed Content Update

We have always felt strongly towards ensuring that every customer of SmartAdmin has an opportunity to grow a strong connection with the entire range of Products of what the Theme has to offer, as such we have always included **Seed** versions of other Flavors, such as PHP, Angular, RubyOnRails and .NET Core, with the HTML Full purchase.

These contributions were to give you a sneak peak of what the other Flavors had to offer and to of course assist you as our loyal customers with the target development platform of your choice. After much considering, we feel that this model does not allow us to fully support the Theme in the way we had envisioned.

### Why is this directory now empty

This means, that starting from this update, we are removing the seeds to encourage adoption of the Full versions. Obtaining the Seed and the Full versions of the Flavor you are interested in, will now only be made available after the purchase of each respective Flavor product on WrapBootstrap and will no longer be part of the HTML Flavor itself.

We do apologize that we have had to take this decision, it was not made lightly. Rest assured though that we will always continue to support the community to our best abilities and with your interest at heart.

Sincerely,
