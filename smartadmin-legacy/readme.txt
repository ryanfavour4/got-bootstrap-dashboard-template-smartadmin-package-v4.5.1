Hi Folks,

I had no idea the legacy version of SmartAdmin would still be so popular among the community. Many of you were asking for it, so I decided to add it back into the package for your convenience. 

Please note, SA v1.9.6.1 is considered a legacy build (a static binary), therefore it is no longer supported. However, there is still a huge community base out there for this version and many are still using it today.

If you are facing issues with it you can always post your questions on our community support forum https://support.gotbootstrap.com

With that in mind, please enjoy :)


Best regards,
Sunny
